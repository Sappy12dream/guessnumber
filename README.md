# Guess the Number Game

Welcome to "Guess the Number" - a simple command-line game written in Rust. This project is a great starting point for beginners to get familiar with Rust programming language fundamentals.

## About the Project

This is my first Rust project, where I've implemented a basic guessing game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player needs to guess that number within a limited number of attempts.

## How I Created the Project

1. **Setting Up Rust**: As a beginner, I started by installing Rust on my machine. I followed the instructions provided on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Writing the Code**: I began by writing the code to implement the game logic. This involved generating a random number, accepting user input, comparing the guess with the secret number, and providing feedback to the player.

3. **Learning Rust Syntax**: Throughout the project, I familiarized myself with Rust syntax and concepts such as ownership, borrowing, and error handling. The pattern matching feature (`match` statement) in Rust was particularly useful for handling different game scenarios.

4. **Testing and Debugging**: I tested the code thoroughly to ensure it worked as expected. Debugging Rust code was a learning experience, especially with features like `println!` for debugging purposes and using the Rust compiler's error messages to identify and fix issues.

5. **Adding README.md**: To document the project and provide instructions for others, I created this `README.md` file. It includes details on how to play the game, how the project was created, and what I've learned along the way.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Rust installed. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
3. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
4. Compile the code using the following command:
   `cargo build --release`
5. Run the executable
6. Follow the instructions to guess the number!

## What I've Learned

- **Basics of Rust**: This project helped me understand the basics of Rust programming, including its syntax, features, and concepts.
- **Error Handling**: I learned how to handle errors using Rust's `Result` type and the `match` statement.
- **Random Number Generation**: The project introduced me to generating random numbers in Rust using the `rand` crate.
- **Command-Line Input/Output**: I gained experience with reading input from the command line and printing output to the console using Rust's standard I/O library.
